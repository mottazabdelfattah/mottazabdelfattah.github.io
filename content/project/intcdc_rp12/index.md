This project comes in the context of the cluster of excellence (IntCDC) which is a big cluster of reserch projects (Funded by the DFG)  covering different discplenesn inclusing social sciece, computer scinece, robotics, engineering etc. all coming together in order pushing the archiecterure, engineering and construction (AEC) indusctry forward to face its chellneges of building housing and infrastructure for over 2.5 billion people in urban areas over the next 30 years. It is not secret that the productivity of AEC industry is stagening if not declining, escpecially if put in comparsion with other industeries such as agrichtlute or automotive where they beefited from automation and dgigtzation decaes ago. Curent methods applied by the AEC and in partcula the constryction sector still labor-intesive and is a significant contributor to climate change, accounting for over 40% of the global energy use, 50% of global waste, and 30% of global greenhouse gases.

In our work, we  tried to chracterics of the AEC industry and explain why it is not that easy to ustomate the indusrt using the same methods applied in other ideustries usch as the automotive indisyry. There area lresy some posminsig efforts towrds eutomating the idustry using computational design methods integrated with robotic
fabrication. Which promises to address many of the challenges that face the AEC industry.  However, in rder to relzie the full potential of these efforts there is a demand for digital tools to back and support them, hence comes the visualziation part.

In that context, I took part in several projects working on building and desginig few visualization tools for archiects. one of them is shown in figure??, the fibervis tool was build to support archiects in exploring the design space of Coreless Filament Wound Structures (cfw). To build such tool, we sually follow  user-centered design methods, such as design studies,4 participatory design,15 or creativity workshops in order to elicit the reuirements, design, build and evaluate the tools.
