title: Computational Co-Design Framework For Fibre Composite Building Systems 
summary: The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive computational co-design framework for fibre composite building systems, which that is based on previous research accomplishments and aims at a higher level of design integration as well as predictability, thus ultimately reducing the necessary safety factors allowing for the building systems and related designs to be even more efficient and sustainable.

The last decade saw a significant foray of integrative computational design strategies, incorpo-rating numerical simulation of engineering problems and advanced digital fabrication systems. These developments allowed for the successful integration of material properties and fabrication constraints into the design process, bridging the gap between the scientific world and the de-signer’s intuition.

In order to advance this approach towards applicability in the realm of large-scale fibre compo-sites in architecture, integrative approaches to the use of digital technologies are required to ad-dress challenges in structural design, manufacturing, quality control, analysis and optimisation. However, digitalisation in the construction sector is often limited to the automation of existing, pre-digital and disciplinary processes to gain higher efficiency [11], which is insufficient to han-dle the collateral requirements of a fibrous building system.

Co-Design is an integrative approach aiming to go beyond disciplinary boundaries employing a digital framework and aiming to exploit the full potential of digitalisation in Architecture, Engi-neering and Construction (AEC). It seeks to examine multiple research areas like planning and engineering methods, manufacturing and construction processes, material and building sys-tems, building culture, regulatory, social and ecological requirements simultaneously, in recipro-cal feedback to foster fundamental innovation in the construction sector [1].

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive computational co-design framework for fibre composite building systems, which that is based on previous research accomplishments and aims at a higher level of design integration as well as predictability, thus ultimately reducing the necessary safety factors allowing for the building systems and related designs to be even more efficient and sustainable.
