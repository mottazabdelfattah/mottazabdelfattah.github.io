abstract: 'There has been a multi-storey timber construction boom since the start of the millennium.
While there is now a body of research on trends, benefits, and disadvantages of timber construction,
there is not yet literature on the wider market or the impact of stakeholders on it. This research
investigates the (i) architects, (ii) engineers, and (iii) manufacturers involved in the realization of
300 contemporary multi-storey timber buildings from an existing survey. The analysis is based on
data sourced from stakeholder websites and the building survey. It evaluates the perceived level of
timber expertise of stakeholders based on service categorization and stakeholder type and relates
them to the buildings they worked on. The research uses quantitative methods to answer qualitative
questions on the connection between architectural variety in timber construction and the stakeholders
involved. Interconnectivity between stakeholders and projects is visualized in an interactive network
graph. The study shows a segmented mass timber market with relatively few impactful design
and construction stakeholders, mostly located in central and northern Europe. It also identifies
fabricators as the largest group of innovators advancing the industry and enabling the construction
of more complex projects. It reveals the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing for the
industry’s growth.'
